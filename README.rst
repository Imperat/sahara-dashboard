OpenStack Dashboard plugin for Sahara project
=============================================

NOTE:
=====

Sahara Dashboard is now integrated into the Horizon project. http://github.com/openstack/horizon
The panels can now be found in the data_processing module of Projects Dashboard.
https://github.com/openstack/horizon/tree/master/openstack_dashboard/dashboards/project/data_processing

This repository will now contain only selenium based tests for the Data Processing Panels.

This change is not meant to be backported to stable/icehouse or any other tags or branches.
So you can still use Sahara Dasboard as a separate dashboard with stable/icehouse version of Horizon.
